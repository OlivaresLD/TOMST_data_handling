# TOMST_data_handling
Collection of scripts to adquire and handle data generated by TOMST soil humidity and temperature sensors
(Wild et al., 2019)

The R script "1 SOILGUARD_TOMST_data_acquisition.R" has the instructions to adquire, process and integrate 
in a single file the raw TOMST data files contained in the "a procesar" folder. The files 

The script uses the "SOILGUARD-WP3_TOMST_ID.xlsx" file with the soil physical parameters required and the 
sensor serial number to file identifications and the "equations.csv" file with the parameters used in the 
R code. All this is based on the equations and calibrations used in the TMS Calibr "TMS3calibr1-11.xlsm" 
utility (excel macro file) at: https://tomst.com/web/en/systems/tms/software/
